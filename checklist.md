### CDC Pipeline Development Checklist

#### 1. Pre-Development Setup
- [x] Understand the specific data requirements and caching needs.
- [x] Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the CloudSQL MySQL instance and other GCP resources.

#### 2. CloudSQL Configuration
- [x] Enable binary logging in the CloudSQL MySQL instance.
- [x] Validate the MySQL instance configuration (e.g., network settings, user permissions).

#### 3. CDC Tool Selection and Setup
- [x] Choose an appropriate CDC tool (e.g., Debezium).
- [x] Set up the CDC tool in the desired environment (e.g., VM, Kubernetes).
- [x] Configure the CDC tool to connect to the CloudSQL instance.

#### 4. Cloud Pub/Sub Integration (Optional)
- [x] Set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub if required.
- [x] Integrate the CDC tool with Pub/Sub for event streaming.

#### 5. Caching Layer Implementation
- [ ] Decide on the caching technology (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- [ ] Deploy and configure the caching solution on GCP.

#### 6. Cache Update Service Development
- [ ] Develop a service to process CDC events and update the cache.
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry mechanisms in the service.

#### 7. Data Consistency and Integrity
- [ ] Implement data validation checks.
- [ ] Schedule regular data consistency audits between the source database and cache.

#### 8. Security and Compliance
- [ ] Ensure data encryption in transit and at rest.
- [ ] Implement necessary access controls and audit logging.

#### 9. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring for the CDC pipeline and caching layer.
- [ ] Implement logging for debugging and tracking purposes.

#### 10. Testing
- [ ] Conduct unit testing for individual components.
- [ ] Perform integration testing for the entire pipeline.
- [ ] Validate the pipeline in a staging environment.

#### 11. Deployment and Maintenance
- [ ] Deploy the pipeline to production.
- [ ] Document the deployment process and configurations.
- [ ] Establish a maintenance and update schedule.

#### 12. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor the system performance and error rates.
- [ ] Optimize based on observed data and performance metrics.
